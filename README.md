# Tkintering with Big Mac
 
This repository is the result of my learning and playing with Tkinter to create basic GUIs. It is intended to become an example for students in Stage 5 Computing Technology and Stage 6 Software Engineering (NSW Courses). More will be added to this README as I learn.

## Lessons

I have provided the files I worked in as I worked through tutorials from the [Python GUIs](https://www.pythonguis.com/) website

1) tkintro.py - [Create a Basic GUI using Tkinter and Python](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/create-gui-tkinter/)

2) tkintering with layouts.py - [Use Tkinter to Design GUI Layout](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/use-tkinter-to-design-gui-layout/)

3) tkintering with buttons.py [Create Buttons in Tkinter](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/create-buttons-in-tkinter/)

4) tkintering with pack layouts.py [Using the Pack Layout Manager in Tkinter](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/create-ui-with-tkinter-pack-layout-manager/)

5) login pack layout.py [Using the Pack Layout Manager in Tkinter](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/create-ui-with-tkinter-pack-layout-manager/)
    - [Click Here to Learn About Message / Dialogue Boxes](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/GUIandEventDrivenProgramming/02_standard_dialog_boxes.html)

6) tkintering with grid layouts.py [Using the Grid Layout Manager in Tkinter](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/create-ui-with-tkinter-grid-layout-manager/)

7) profile with grid.py [Using the Grid Layout Manager in Tkinter](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/create-ui-with-tkinter-grid-layout-manager/)

8) It is recommended you also try place layouts. [Click here for a Guide to Place Layouts](https://www.pythonguis.com/tutorials/create-ui-with-tkinter-place-layout-manager/)

9) Check out mcTkinter.py for an example of this in action with Pandas and Matplotlib! [Click here to find out how to embed a plot from Matplotlib into Tkinter!](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-embed-matplotlib-charts-in-tkinter-gui/)

## Extension
- Check out *questionable_tkinterface.py* for an example of how to create an escape room styled game with different windows using Tkinter. No knowledge of classes necessary, this is all completed using functions (suitable for Year 9-10 level).

## Hyper Extension
- Check out *return_of_the_tkinter.py*. This text-based adventure is similar in nature to one you may have seen in Year 8 or 9, but now has a basic GUI and uses classes to transition from scene to scene without opening new windows. See if you can apply the logic there to create your own changing interface. **Not for the faint of heart. Advanced users only, as it uses concepts covered in Year 11 and up.**
