# Tkintering with Big Mac
 
This repository is the result of my learning and playing with Tkinter to create basic GUIs. It is intended to become an example for students in Stage 5 Computing Technology and Stage 6 Software Engineering (NSW Courses). More will be added to this README as I learn.

## Lessons

I have provided the files I worked in as I worked through tutorials from the [Python GUIs](https://www.pythonguis.com/) website
